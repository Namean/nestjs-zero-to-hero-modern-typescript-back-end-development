Installing Node.js and Yarn



Node.js

Installing Node.js is very straightforward. Visit the Node.js Download Page and download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system.



Yarn

I will be using the Yarn package manager throughout the course. You can find instructions on how to install it for your operating system in the [Yarn website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).


## Install via npm

It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system.

Once you have npm installed you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```
```
```


Once you are done installing Node.js and Yarn, please proceed to the next lecture.
